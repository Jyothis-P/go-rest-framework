# go-rest-framework
An opinionated web framework with go and mongo which can let you hit the ground running for simple REST APIs

Idea is to have a framework which can get you started with your REST API as fast as possible. Obviously if you need someone else to set all of this up for you, that means someone else will be taking some decisions for you. For now, GRF works with mongodb. 
You will need to setup Mongodb in your environment. If you don't have it and you just need something to get everything up and running fast, I'd recommend checking out [run-rs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/run-rs).
